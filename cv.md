 _ I want to find my first job as a front-end developer. _

 _ Basically, I learned everything myself without the help of any courses, using only Google _

 _ I want to replenish my knowledge with different chips, frameworks, just go toe to toe with modern development _


1. HTML
1. CSS
    - SCSS
    - adaptive layout
1. Javascript
    -TypeScript
1. React
4. Bootstrap, tailwind

```
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
}

```

_ I created an interactive map using React and Typescript. The map was created using the Leaflet library, and Tailwind CSS was used for styling. The header displays the current exchange rates for USD and EUR and the weather forecast for Kharkiv. To obtain this data, I used the MonoBank currency API and the OpenWeather API and made requests to the server using Axios.

I used the .map method to iterate over several dynamic data points, including coordinates and object names, to create markers on the map.

The current functionality of this application includes the ability to find some noodle places in Kharkiv, locate a couple of parks for a stroll after the noodles, use a search function (which works strangely, but still shows something), and obtain the current exchange rates from MonoBank and the weather in Kharkiv. _
